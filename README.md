# Boot.dev Learn Git Course
In this repo, I have completed the [Learn Git](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-git) course from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev).

I am aware that there are two "M" commits in this repo, I believe it is an issue with the course and have raised an issue.

Otherwise, this course was great and I highly recommend it for brushing up on your git fundamentals.
